# Feed Reader Testing

Test-Driven Development

In order to run the tests, you have to clone or download this repository and open `index.html` with a browser (setting it as a GitHub Page conflicts with my website configured here with a custom domain).

### Instructions

It’s enough to open `index.html` since I haven’t changed anything but the `jasmine/spec/feedreader.js` yet.
